I am Ayesha S. Dina, an Assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science in Florida Polytechnic University.
I completed my Ph.D. and M.Sc degrees in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky. Initially, I worked as a research assistant in a bioinformatics lab analyzing plant genes. In order to pursue my Ph.D., I joined Distributed and Mobile Computing Systems Research Group that focuses on computer networks security. My research interests encompass a diverse array of subjects, notably Computer Network Security, Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, and Bioinformatics.
Beyond my academic pursuits, my origins trace back to Bangladesh. I find solace in savoring tea, and I'm known to be a dedicated patron of Starbucks. On a personal note, I derive immense joy from embarking on road trips alongside my daughter. In addition to my field of study, I am interested in exploring other research areas as well.
